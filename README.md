# StickyHTMLTableHeaders

HTML, with a lot of additional stuff. Highlights:

*	Uses a `<table>` for layout so it avoids flash of unscripted content
*	Row and Column Headers are generated thru DOM duplication.
*	Row and Column Headers are sticky and stays within the bounds.
* Layout during view tossing is correct
*	Mobile (iPad) friendly
*	Desktop (Chrome) friendly
*	Scroller friendly
